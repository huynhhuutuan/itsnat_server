ItsNat Feature Showcase Project
--------------------------------------------

The ItsNat Feature Showcase is a special Java AJAX web application developed with ItsNat.

Is included into the ItsNat distribution and shows most of the ItsNat features with examples
including source code viewable online and explanations.

The Feature Showcase code is not part of the ItsNat Server Framework, the license is very liberal, 
use the source code as you want including closed source developments.

Developed with Maven and NetBeans.

It depends of course of itsnat_server-X.Y.jar and itsnat_web_custom_comp-1.0.jar (an example of jar-contained custom component based on custom tags).
