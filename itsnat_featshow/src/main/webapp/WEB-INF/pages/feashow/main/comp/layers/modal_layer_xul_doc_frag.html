<div class="explanation">

    <p>Modal layers in XUL are similar to HTML/XHTML, there are some significative
        differences: z-index is ignored because XUL does not have this property,
        by default a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/panel" target="_blank">&lt;panel&gt;</a>
        element is used and user markup should be included below this element.
    </p>
    <p>In XUL only the first &lt;panel&gt; is modal, if you need two or more modal layers the "clean below" feature can be used
        to avoid the non-modal behavior of the second and successive layers.
