    <p>ItsNat provides several DOM utility classes and interfaces to help the DOM
        manipulation at the server.
    </p>
    <p>Utilities like pluggable DOM renderers, element lists, tables or trees,
    variable resolvers and <code>ElementCSSInlineStyle</code> support.
    </p>
    <p>Most of them are designed to manage DOM Element nodes because the DOM Element
    is the main structural node type of a DOM tree. Typical W3C DOM methods deal with every node type
    with no distinction, ItsNat DOM utilities usually ignore any nodes different to DOM Elements.
