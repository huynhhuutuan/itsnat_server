<div class="explanation">
    <p>As in normal buttons, any DOM element can be a check box button component,
    an <code>ItsNatFreeCheckBox</code> object can be attached to any DOM element including non-HTML namespaces.
    The behaviour is the same as HTML based check buttons, the main difference is that
    no default decoration is defined when the button is selected.
    In this case server based decoration is the preferred because
    the server knows the selection state.
