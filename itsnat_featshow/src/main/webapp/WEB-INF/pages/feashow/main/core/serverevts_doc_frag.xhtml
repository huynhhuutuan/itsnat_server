        From the server we can fire W3C DOM events simulating the user behavior.
        These events can be sent to the browser simulating user actions
        or directly dispatched to the server.
    </p>
    <p>Server-sent events is one of the most interesting ItsNat features.
     This feature has many applications, the most important are bookmarking
     and functional testing, in fact events fired by the server may be seen as a sort of
     built-in functional testing capability.
    </p>
    <p>This feature is amazingly useful to make an integrated test system to
    functionally test a web application, because after every event
    sent from the server we can evaluate if that event did its job
    for instance checking the data mode or the view state (the server DOM).
    There is a component based example showing this technique.
