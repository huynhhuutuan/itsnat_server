<div class="explanation">
    <p><code>ItsNatLabel</code> components leverage the DOM utility <code>ElementLabel</code>
        adding a data model and in-place editing. In-place editing is the most
        interesting feature of labels, when the user clicks or double clicks
        the label area an editor is instanced replacing the label, this editor
        is designed to get a new label value, when the user ends the edition
        the editor is removed and the label markup is restored updated with the new value.
    </p>
    <p>Label editors are pluggable and implement the interface <code>ItsNatLabelEditor</code>
        this inherits from <code>javax.swing.CellEditor</code>. ItsNat provides
        a default label editor implementation, this editor works as a container
        of a user defined ItsNat component and this component is finally used to edit in-place
        the label value. Edition can be disabled, if disabled a label component
        is basically an <code>ElementLabel</code>.
