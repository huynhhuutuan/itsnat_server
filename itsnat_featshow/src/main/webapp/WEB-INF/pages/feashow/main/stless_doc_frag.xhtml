<div class="explanation">
    <p>This is the root of examples using the <b>Stateless</b> mode of ItsNat.</p>
    <p>Stateless mode is a different way of using ItsNat where there is no use of the session object, 
        by this way stateless events (AJAX/SCRIPT) can be dispatched to any symmetric isolated server 
        if neither end developer code makes use of session for storing data.</p>
    <p>If end developer stores session data (ItsNatSession can still be used), only these data needs to be replicated between servers,
       therefore sticky sessions are no longer needed.</p>
    <p>In stateless mode the client/server contract is not so strict and in the same time developers can make use of the powerful
       plain HTML templating system of ItsNat.</p>
    <p>By using stateless mode you can make powerful and complex <b>Single Page Interface Server Centric Stateless SEO Compatible Web Sites and Applications</p>.</p>
