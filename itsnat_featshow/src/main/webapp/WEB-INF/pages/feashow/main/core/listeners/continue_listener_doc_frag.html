<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows how to register and use a "continue event listener".
        The ItsNat continue event/listener is an implementation of the <i>continuation</i>
        concept translated to the web using events and inner classes.
    </p>
    <p>The method <code>ClientDocument.addContinueEventListener</code> is used to register
        a continuation listener ready to receive a "continue event" (<code>ItsNatContinueEvent</code>).
    </p>
    <p>How it works: when the listener is registered ItsNat automatically sends to the client a command
        to send a continue event this event is received after calling the handler method of the listener.
        This technique is very useful to request more info from the client with no user interaction to complete a server task
        or to show the progress of a long server task divided in parts.
    </p>
    <p>There is no remove method because the listener is automatically unregistered
        when the continue event is received.
