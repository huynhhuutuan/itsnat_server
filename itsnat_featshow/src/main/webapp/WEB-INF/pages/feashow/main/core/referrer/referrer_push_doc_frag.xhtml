<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example does the same as the "pull" example but using the referrer "push" technique.</p>
    <p>The referrer "push" technique is the opposite to the pull approach,
        in this case the source page actively <i>pushes</i> DOM nodes or data to the
        target page <i>before</i> the target listeners are executed and before
        the source page is destroyed (replaced with the target page in the browser).
    </p>
    <p>To enable the push technique the source page must register
        an <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> object calling
        <code>ItsNatDocument.addReferrerItsNatServletRequestListener</code>,
        this listener is called when the page is going to be replaced with
        a new ItsNat page (only if this target page accepts to be "pushed", see
        <code>ItsNatDocumentTemplate.setReferrerPushEnabled</code>).
        The <code>request</code> and <code>response</code>
        parameters are the objects going to be processed in the normal
        target load process. This is an opportunity to the source to "push" DOM nodes
        and data to the target <code>ItsNatDocument</code> before the source is
        destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>The push technique needs events, again events (AJAX or SCRIPT) are used to improve classical navigation,
        and again may be used to detect the back and forward buttons, reload etc.
