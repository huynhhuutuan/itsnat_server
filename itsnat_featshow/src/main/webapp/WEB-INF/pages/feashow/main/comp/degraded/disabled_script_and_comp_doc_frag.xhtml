<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example is very similar to the disabled events example, in this case no JavaScript
        must be sent to the client, calls like <code>ItsNatDocument.addCodeToSend(Object)</code>
        have been replaced by DOM based notification (DOM manipulation
        does not generate JavaScript code in the load phase, the "fastLoad" mode
        is supposed).
