<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example shows how ItsNat can work with other namespaces like SVG
        embedded in XHTML. In browsers with SVG support (like FireFox, Opera, Safari, IPhone 2.1+,
        MSIV v9 or MSIE v6,7,8 with a SVG plugin etc), a SVG element embedded in an HTML document can receive DOM events,
        so this element can be used as an event target in the server too.
    </p>
    <p>The example also shows how a DOM utility like <code>ElementList</code>
        can be used to manage a SVG element list, because DOM utilities are
        namespace and tag agnostic.
    </p>
    <p>Note: in this case the XHTML document containing SVG is served with MIME type "text/html"
       so an iframe is used. Internet Explorer (v6,7 and 8) doesn't support "application/xhtml+xml"
       (in this case a SVG plugin does not help). Do not worry, ItsNat supports SVG in X/HTML
       served with MIME type "text/html", this feature is shown in another example.
