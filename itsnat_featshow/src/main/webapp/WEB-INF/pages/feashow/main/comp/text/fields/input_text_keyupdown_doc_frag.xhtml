<div class="explanation">
    <p>By default text based components are only updated from the client when
        a "change" event is fired (the control loses the focus). Optionally
        can change when the control has the focus and user presses a key.
        Be sure you need this feature because every key pressed is sent to
        the server as an event.
    </p>
    <p>The event types "keyup" and "keydown" must be enabled
    (in fact only the "keyup" is necessary) in the component.
    The "keypress" event is not supported because this event type can be cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>Key up and down events are compatible with the "change" event (in fact is redundant).</p>
