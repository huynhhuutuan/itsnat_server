<div class="explanation">
    <p>Components can be degraded to a disabled events, in this mode
        events are of course disabled and event related methods do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway components are very useful in this mode too, this example
        shows how we can build a disabled events component based application using
        classical navigation. When a page ends the built components are lost
        (because the document is lost too), to avoid this problem we can
        save the document to the session, then the next page can got the old
        document to reuse interesting things as the component data models
        the current selection state, to import DOM subtrees etc; this technique minimizes the client data submitted
        to the next page via HTTP.
