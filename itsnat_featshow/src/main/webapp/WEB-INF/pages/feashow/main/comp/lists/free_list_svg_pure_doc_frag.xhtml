<div class="explanation">
    <p>Free combo boxes and free multiple selection lists are tag and
       namespace agnostic. XHTML components can be used in
       non-XHTML documents with support of XHTML elements embedded (like SVG or XUL).
    </p>
    <p>This is an example of how we can build a list of SVG based circles
        including selection in a pure SVG page, alongside
        some XHTML components embedded.
    </p>
    <p>The same Java code is shared with the SVG embedded in XHTML example
        because in both cases the elements used are the same (of course in
        a different container and layout).
    </p>
    <p>Note: XHTML embedded in SVG is a cutting edge feature of SVG capable browsers
        like FireFox, Opera, Chrome and Safari, rendering of these elements may be
        not fully correct.
