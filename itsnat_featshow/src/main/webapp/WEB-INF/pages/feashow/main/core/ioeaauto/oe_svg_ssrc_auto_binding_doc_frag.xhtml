<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example is a variant of the previous one, in this case
       we need MSIE with Savarese Ssrc SVG/XUL or a browser with native SVG.
    </p>
    <p>When a SVG document is loaded by Ssrc through an &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt;
       when the domain is the same, we have very limited access to the child document,
       most of properties of the child document are read-only. Fortunately we can
       change <code>LocationURL</code> indirectly calling <code>Navigate(url)</code> and
       using the #reference part of the URL we can "talk" to the child document
       and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>Savarese Ssrc SVG/XUL with &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; needs absolute URLs, fortunately
       ItsNat auto-binding feature works with absolute URLs when the path of the parent document is the same.
    </p>
    <p>With &lt;iframe&gt; there is no way to communicate parent and child documents in client because
        <code>LocationURL</code> is not defined.
