    <p>ItsNat provides five communication modes for events:
    <ol>
        <li>AJAX Synchronous <br /><br />
            In this mode the browser is locked
            until the event sent to the server returns.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>AJAX Asynchronous <br /><br />
            In this mode the event is sent
            asynchronously, the browser can fire and send
            to the server new events.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>AJAX Asynchronous-Hold <br /><br />
            Is provided by ItsNat, in this mode
            the event is sent to the server asynchronously (the browser is not locked)
            but any new event fired to be sent to the server is queued as a FIFO,
            when the first event returns the first queued event is
            sent to the server (applying its synchronization rule).
            This mode is very interesting because offers synchronous/predictable
            behavior with no browser locks.
        </li>
        <li>SCRIPT <br /><br />
            In this mode auxiliary SCRIPT elements are used for events,
            this type of communication is essentially asynchronous.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>SCRIPT Hold<br /><br />
            This mode is based on SCRIPT elements but using the same technique of
            AJAX Asynchronous-Hold to provide a synchronous/predictable
            behavior with no browser locks.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
    </ol>
