    <p>"AJAX Timers" are a sort of COMET. ItsNat provides a "conceptual" port of the standard <code>java.util.Timer</code> class
        to the web, the <code>ItsNatTimer</code> interface. An ItsNat timer
        is created calling <code>ClientDocument.createItsNatTimer(...)</code>.
        Timers can also be configured to be transported by auxiliary SCRIPT elements.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>ItsNatTimer</code> interface has methods very similar to the standard class
         (signature and behavior), the main difference is that timing is done in the client (no background thread is used) and
        timer events are send by the client using AJAX or auxiliary SCRIPT elements and received by timer listeners
        as <code>ItsNatTimerEvent</code> objects.
