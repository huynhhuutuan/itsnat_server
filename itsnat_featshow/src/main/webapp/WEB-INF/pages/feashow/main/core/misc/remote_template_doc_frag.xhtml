<div class="explanation">

    <p>In any typical ItsNat application, markup templates (for documents and fragments) are based
       on local files specified by the file path when the template is registered,
       notwithstanding there are more options like remote files specified by URLs
       or user defined sources implementing <code>TemplateSource</code>.
    </p>
    <p>When a remote file is specified by its URL (as a String) ItsNat loads the remote
       file the first time the template is needed (to build one document or fragment)
       and there is no further reloading.
    </p>
    <p>Because previous approaches may be not flexible enough, ItsNat provides a mechanism
       to specify custom template sources implementing the interface <code>TemplateSource</code>.
       By this interface developers can return the required template to be used in
       a per request basis. This feature opens ItsNat to build sophisticated
       front ends/proxies/filters of any web application/site.
    </p>
    
    <p>This example shows how we can use ItsNat as a front end of Google Search taking
        on demand the pages returned by Google as template sources, modifying them
        including events transported with AJAX.
