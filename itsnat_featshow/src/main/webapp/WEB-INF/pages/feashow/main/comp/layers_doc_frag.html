<div class="explanation">
    <p>A modal layer is an absolute positioned element usually opaque or translucent
    with a z-index greater than the elements being covered and covering the
    complete area of the web page. Modal layers are useful to build "modal elements"
    simulating desktop modal windows in web.
    </p>

    <p>The modal layer is added as a direct child of the visual root element (&lt;body&gt; in HTML
    &lt;svg&gt; in SVG) added in the end. This way any mouse click is not dispatched to
    any covered element in the document.
    </p>
    <p>By default there is no markup content contained by the modal layer, new markup
    can be added "on top" of the modal layer specifing a greater z-index.
    This new markup should be added in the end of the visual root element.
    </p>

    <p>In pure SVG documents behavior is very similar to X/HTML, the main difference is
    z-index is ignored in SVG because z-order in SVG follows the rendering order,
    this order coincides with document order. <a href="http://wiki.svg.org/Rendering_Order">More info</a>.
