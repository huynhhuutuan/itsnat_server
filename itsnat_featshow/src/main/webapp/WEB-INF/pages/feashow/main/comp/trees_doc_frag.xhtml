<div class="explanation">
    <p><code>ItsNatTree</code> components leverage the DOM utility <code>ElementTree</code>
        adding a data model, <code>javax.swing.tree.TreeModel</code>, a tree node selection system
        and in-place editing similar to labels. Almost single tree node is needed
        as pattern (trees are all "free" because there is no HTML &lt;tree&gt; tag).
    </p>
    <p>The selection system uses <code>javax.swing.tree.TreeSelectionModel</code>
        objects and no selection decoration is defined by default. The Feature Showcase
        defines a class <code>FreeTreeDecorator</code> reused by the tree examples
        (this class is not part of ItsNat Framework use it as you want).
    </p>
    <p>Node expansion and collapsing is supported by the component as a response
        of mouse events but there is no visual impact by default, the component
        fires <code>javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent</code> events
        to registered <code>TreeWillExpandListener</code> calling
        <code>ItsNatTree.addTreeWillExpandListener</code> and
        to registered <code>TreeExpansionListener</code> listeners
        calling <code>ItsNatTree.addTreeExpansionListener</code> listeners
        if expansion/collapsing was not vetoed. Again the
        <code>FreeTreeDecorator</code> class is used to expand and collapse tree nodes.
    </p>
    <p>Tree components support rootless and tree-tables and they are
        supported by the <code>FreeTreeDecorator</code>.
