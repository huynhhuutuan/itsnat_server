<div class="explanation">
    <p>The following example shows how we can embed SVG in an X/HTML document
        served with MIME text/html (the Feature Showcase uses this MIME).
        It works in MSIE 6+ with Adobe SVG Viewer v3 installed,
        and browsers with native SVG support (the &lt;object&gt; tag and &lt;?import?&gt; processing instruction are ignored, SVG
        code is rendered natively).
    </p>
    <p>See the Reference Manual to know the limitations of this approach in MSIE.
