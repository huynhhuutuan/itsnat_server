<div class="explanation">
    <p>In ItsNat any DOM element can be a button because any element can receive mouse
       clicks. ItsNat button components can be used to manage the state of buttons
       with Swing data models (and related listeners), for instance to manage states as in toggle buttons.
    </p>
    <p>All ItsNat buttons implements the interface <code>ItsNatButton</code>.</p>
    <p>There are two button types: normal (buttons with no permanent state) and
       toggle buttons (buttons with a selection state). Both types use
       <code>javax.swing.ButtonModel</code> and related listeners as the button model.
