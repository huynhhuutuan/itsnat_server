<div class="explanation">
    <p>JavaScript disabled mode is the most downgraded mode of ItsNat
    (see <code>ItsNatDocumentTemplate.setScriptingEnabled</code>),
    in this mode no JavaScript is sent to the client by ItsNat.
    Of course events are also disabled.
    </p>
    <p>In spite of JavaScript is missing some ItsNat features can be used in load time:
        DOM view manipulation, DOM utilities, fragments ... (these
        only can work in fast load mode, see <code>ItsNatDocumentTemplate.setFastLoadMode</code>).
