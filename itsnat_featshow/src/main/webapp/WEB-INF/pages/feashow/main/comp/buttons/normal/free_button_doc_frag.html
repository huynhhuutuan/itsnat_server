<div class="explanation">
    <p>Any DOM element can be a normal button component, an <code>ItsNatFreeButtonNormal</code>
    object can be attached to any DOM element including non-HTML namespaces.
    The behaviour is the same as HTML based buttons, the main difference is that
    no default decoration is defined when the button is pressed.
    Server based decoration is not recommended because it involves
    the unnecessary separation of a "click" event as two events "mousedown"
    and "mouseup", use JavaScript DOM listeners (onmousedown/up handlers) or CSS
    (:hover and :active pseudoclasses).
