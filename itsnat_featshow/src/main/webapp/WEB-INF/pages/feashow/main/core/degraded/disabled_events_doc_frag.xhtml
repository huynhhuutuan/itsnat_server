<div class="explanation">
    <p>ItsNat is designed with events (AJAX or SCRIPT based) in mind but it supports a downgraded
        mode with events disabled (see <code>ItsNatDocumentTemplate.setEventsEnabled(boolean)</code>).
        In this mode the page is loaded normally but there are no events (ItsNat methods related with events
        do nothing, no JavaScript code related to events is send to the client).
    </p>
    <p>In spite of events disabled any feature not based on events can be used in load time like
        DOM view manipulation, DOM utilities, fragments...
