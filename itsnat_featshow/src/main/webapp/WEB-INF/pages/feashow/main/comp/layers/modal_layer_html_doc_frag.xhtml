<div class="explanation">

    <p>This example shows how to build an HTML modal layer component.
    Two modal layers are showed and stacked.
    </p>
    <p>In some browsers some form controls are problematic (for instance &lt;select&gt; in MSIE 6)
    because z-index is ignored. To avoid these controls to be clicked ItsNat hide them when appropriated.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>clean below</i> mode is useful to avoid accessing form controls below
    a modal layer using "tab navigation" (the enter key can be used to "click").
    In this mode any element "behind" the modal layer are hidden (display:none).
    This mode is useful in browsers with no support of absolute
    positioned elements.
