<div class="explanation">
    <p>In this example the submit button is contained by a form, now
        a submit sends the form leaving the page. This an opportunity
        to show how an event can be cancelled in the server calling
        <code>org.w3c.dom.events.Event.preventDefault()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The cancellation only works in AJAX synchronous mode because the
        cancellation only is possible inside the client event processing
        immediately after the event is fired, this is not an ItsNat limitation
        is a limitation of browsers.
        To send/receive button clicks in AJAX synchronous mode the call
        <code>ItsNatComponent.setEventListenerParams(...,CommMode.XHR_SYNC,...)</code> sets the
        communication mode to AJAX synchronous (by default the Feature Showcase mode
        is <code>CommMode.XHR_ASYNC_HOLD</code> a deterministic variation of the asynchronous mode).
    </p>
    <p>Some browsers (usually based on old WebKit versions) do not support
       synchronous AJAX.
    </p>
    <p>The same is applied to &lt;input&gt; buttons with type "reset" inside forms.
