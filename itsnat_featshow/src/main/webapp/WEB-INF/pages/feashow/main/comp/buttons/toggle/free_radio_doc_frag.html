<div class="explanation">
    <p>Again as in check box buttons, any DOM element can be a radio button component,
    an <code>ItsNatFreeRadioButton</code> object can be attached to any DOM element including non-HTML namespaces.
    There is no default decoration of the selection state.
    In this case server based decoration is the preferred because
    the server knows the selection state.
