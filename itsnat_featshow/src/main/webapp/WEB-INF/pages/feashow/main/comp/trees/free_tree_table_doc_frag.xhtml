<div class="explanation">
    <p>This example builds a tree-table, the tree-table declaration is
    specified using an artifact.
    </p>
    <p>This tree-table uses a custom data model with two values per node,
        both are showed in table rows. A custom renderer and editor are defined too.
    </p>
    <p>This example is not fully complete, for instance, the second parameter
        has not an in-place editor (using a label?) but this goes beyond the scope of
        this example.
