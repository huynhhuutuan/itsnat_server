<div class="explanation">
    <p>In this case the browser is not used to dispatch events, Java W3C DOM events are directly dispatched
    to the server listeners following the W3C DOM Events standard. These events simulate user actions performed
    in the server based "Java Web Browser".
    </p>

    <p>The code is almost the same as the previous example (using the browser)
    because required events are the same, but there are differences:
    no special threads and document locks are needed, a normal servlet-request thread may be used and events
    are ever dispatched synchronously (no timeouts, communication modes, waits etc needed).
    </p>

    <p>There is no visual change in this example because the city list is cleared
        after the test returning again to an empty list (the starting point).
