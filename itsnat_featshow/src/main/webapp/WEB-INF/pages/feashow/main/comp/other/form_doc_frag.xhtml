<div class="explanation">
    <p>Current implementation of the form component, <code>ItsNatHTMLForm</code>,
        does not do very much. The methods <code>submit</code> and <code>reset</code>
        can be used to call these methods in the client.
    </p>
    <p>This example shows how we can capture a "submit" event and cancel it,
        and how the form is reset from the server (by clicking the link).
