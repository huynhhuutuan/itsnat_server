    <p>This example shows how to embed SVG elements in X/HTML served with text/html MIME.
        The code is basically the same as the previous example (in this case fully integrated into
        the Feature Showcase without iframe).
    </p>
    <p>In theory SVG (or any other non-XHTML element like XUL or MathML) cannot be embedded in X/HTML served with text/html,
       this is partially true. In practice appropriately reinserting the markup
       (using a similar technique to <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/05/HOWTO-Embed-MathML-and-SVG-into-HTML4" taget="_blank">this</a>,
       although the ItsNat approach is better) and avoiding innerHTML to insert SVG, we can
       use embedded SVG (or XUL or MathML...) with no problem and no special coding, "smart reinsertion" is done automatically
       by ItsNat when the page is loaded and ItsNat appropriately inserts new SVG markup.
    </p>

    <p>Another interesting teaching of this example is how to dynamically load/insert/remove a &lt;style&gt; element
        into the &lt;head&gt; of the page.
