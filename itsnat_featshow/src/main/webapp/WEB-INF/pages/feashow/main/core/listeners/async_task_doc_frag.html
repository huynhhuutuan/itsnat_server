<div class="explanation">
    <p>ItsNat automatically locks (synchronizes) the <code>ItsNatDocument</code>
        object during event processes, this prevents other asynchronous events
        to modify the server document and dependent objects concurrently, so the
        server user code may be thread unsafe with no problem.
    </p>
    <p>The drawback of this approach is asynchronous long server tasks, the recommended
        technique is to execute this long task using a different (or new) thread
        to avoid locking the server document during long time.
    </p>

    <p>ItsNat helps to notify the client when an asynchronous long task finishes,
        registering the <code>Runnable</code> object to execute in a new thread
        calling <code>ClientDocument.addAsynchronousTask</code>, of course using AJAX or SCRIPT elements
        behind the scenes. When the long task finishes any DOM node tree change or JavaScript
        added to send to the client (calling <code>ItsNatDocument.addCodeToSend</code>)
        is returned to the client automatically.
