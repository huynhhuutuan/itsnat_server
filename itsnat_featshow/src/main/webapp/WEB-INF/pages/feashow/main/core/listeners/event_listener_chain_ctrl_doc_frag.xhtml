<div class="explanation">
    <p>ItsNat sends an event from client to server per listener registered,
    that is to say one server listener is dispatched per event.
    </p>
    <p>This is not applied to global listeners registered in servlet, template or document;
    these listeners are executed <i>before</i> normal listeners in the same request/event processing.
    </p>
    <p>Event listener chain control can be used by global listeners to control how following listeners
        are executed, for instance, if <code>ItsNatEventListenerChain.continueChain()</code>
        is executed the listener dispatching flow follows this path, that is to say, next listeners will be executed
        before returning this method. This feature can be used to catch exceptions, to open and commit transactions etc.
    </p>
    <p>The call <code>ItsNatEventListenerChain.stop()</code> may be used to stop the normal dispatching flow,
       listeners following (including global) are not executed.
