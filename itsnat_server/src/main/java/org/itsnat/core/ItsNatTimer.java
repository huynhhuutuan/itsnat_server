/**
 * Utility interface to manage scheduled remote tasks (timer tasks).
 * An ItsNat scheduled or timer task is a task executed following a time based schedule,
 * when the task must be executed the client sends an event received
 * by a user defined listener (the task to execute).
 *
 * <p>The ItsNatTimer features and API are inspired in <code>java.util.Timer</code>
 * but the main differences are that timer events are sent by the client
 * and the server does not use any special thread to schedule the event sequence.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: big documentation parts of this interface are copied from
 * <code>java.util.Timer</code>.</p>
