/**
 * Is the base interface of the User Interface utility object associated to
 * the component.
 *
 * <p>This utility object manages only the markup layout of the component.
 * The component calls UI methods typically as response of data model changes
 * to synchronize the markup to match the data model.
 * The UI object does not need the data model (if the component has one), only
 * the tree UI implementation uses the tree data model internally.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This architecture, inspired in Swing, separates the layout manager (the UI object) and the
 * component object working as a coordinator of data and selection models, UI
 * and event based actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>User code may use UI methods to "query" the markup of the component.</p>
