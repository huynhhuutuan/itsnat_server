/**
 * Is the interface of Modal Layer components.
 *
 * <p>A modal layer is an absolute positioned element usually opaque or translucent
 * with a z-index greater than the elements being covered and covering the
 * complete area of the web page.
 * </p>
 * <p>The modal layer is added as a direct child of the root element (&lt;body&gt; in HTML
 * documents) added in the end. This way any mouse click is not dispatched to
 * any covered element in the document.
 * </p>
 * <p>By default there is no markup content contained by the modal layer, new markup
 * can be added "on top" of the modal layer specifing a greater z-index.
 * This new markup should be added in the end of the root element (&lt;body&gt; in HTML).
 * </p>
 * <p>The component automatically removes the modal layer element when the component
 * is disposed, markup with greater z-index should be removed before.
 * </p>
 * <p>ItsNat default implementation supports several stacked modal layers
 * and automatically fixes the problem of HTML SELECT elements of MSIE v6,
 * in this case HTML SELECT elements are hidden when covered by a modal layer
 * (stacked layers are supported too).
 * </p>
 * <p>If no element is provided when the component is created, the default implementation
 * creates one used internally.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>In pure SVG documents behavior is very similar to X/HTML, the main difference is
 * z-index is ignored in SVG because z-order in SVG follows the rendering order,
 * this order coincides with document order. <a href="http://wiki.svg.org/Rendering_Order">More info</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>In XUL documents z-index is ignored because XUL ignores the z-index CSS property.
 * By default uses a &lt;panel&gt; element as layer, this element must be used as the container
 * of any user markup shown "on top" of the layer. If <code>popuphidden</code> event is enabled
 * calling {@link ItsNatComponent#enableEventListener(String)} or adding an
 * event listener listening to the component for this event (calling {@link ItsNatComponent#addEventListener(String,EventListener,boolean)}),
 * the component will be automatically disposed when an event is received
 * (in XUL the popuphidden event closes the panel, by this way the component
 * is "closed" in server too).
 * </p>
