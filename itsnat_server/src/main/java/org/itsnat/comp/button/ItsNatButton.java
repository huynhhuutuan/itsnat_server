 * Is the base interface of button components.

 * <p>A button component manages a <code>javax.swing.ButtonModel</code>,
 * user actions updates this model accordingly. Default button model
 * depends on the concrete button type (normal, toggle etc). Button model listeners
 * may be used to keep track of the button state changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>In spite of ItsNat specifies interfaces bound to the typical form based buttons,
 * any (X)HTML element can be an ItsNat button (free buttons), however ItsNat does not define
 * a default decoration, button model listeners may be used to decorate
 * any button state.</p>
